# DeoPack Updater
**The update program to keep the [DeoPack](https://github.com/xxEmilySmitxx/DeoPack) up-to-date**

_The `data` folder contains a placeholder file so that I could upload a folder to GitHub, the folder will be empty using the download link_

## Installation

Download the DeoPack Updater [here!](https://deocraft.net/resources/DeoPack-Updater.zip)  
_There is a chance Windows Defender, or another anitvirus, will stop the download because it contains an .exe file.  
For Windows Defender, you need to allow this download by going to Virus & threat protection, for other antiviruses you have to look (or google) yourself._

Unzip the file,
Inside the `DeoPack Updater` folder are 2 items;
  1. A `data` folder
  2. The `DeoPack Updater.exe`

**The program needs to have a `data` folder in the same directory as the program itself, so do not move/delete the `data` folder.**

You can save the `DeoPack Updater` folder anywhere you like, as long as it contains the 2 required items.
