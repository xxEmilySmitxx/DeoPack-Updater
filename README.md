# DeoPack Updater
**The Update program to keep the [DeoPack](https://github.com/xxEmilySmitxx/DeoPack) up-to-date**

_The `data` folder contains a placeholder file so that I could upload a folder to GitHub, the folder will be emptied after the first update._

## Installation

Download the DeoPack Updater [here!](https://deocraft.serv.nu/resources/DeoPack-Updater.zip)

Unzip the file,
Inside the `DeoPack Updater` folder are 2 items;
  1. A `data` folder
  2. The `DeoPack Updater.exe`

**The program needs to have a `data` folder in the same directory as the program itself, so do not move/delete the `data` folder.**

You can save the `DeoPack Updater` folder anywhere you like, as long as it contains the 2 required items.


## Usage

Simply run the `DeoPack Updater.exe`, select the version you want to update, and press `Update!`.  
The program will do the rest!

_Even if you don't have a certain DeoPack version, you can run the program and install it from there._
